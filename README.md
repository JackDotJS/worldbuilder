# origin story or whatever

(originally posted to Discord on January 16, 2023)

Long before I became interested in programming, many of my oldest projects revolved around stories I've written and roleplays I liked to do with many old friends back in the day. Later, when I was still very, *very* new to web development, I tried creating a lil web tool simply called "Character Creator Helper". The idea was to provide a massive, blank character sheet, which people could've used to help develop better(-ish) characters by sorta getting you to ask questions about the character and filling in the blanks where needed. That original design consisted almost entirely of a webpage with hundreds of different text boxes. It was extremely overwhelming to look at, let alone to create with my skills at the time. It... was not great, needless to say.

In recent weeks, I've become interested in revisiting some of my storywriting projects, and I've more recently remembered this lil coding project I was once working on. I think i'd like to further expand upon the idea, to help create not just characters, but perhaps entire universes.

Frankly, I dont know if anyone besides myself would even be interested in such a tool, but it'll be an interesting side project for the time being.
